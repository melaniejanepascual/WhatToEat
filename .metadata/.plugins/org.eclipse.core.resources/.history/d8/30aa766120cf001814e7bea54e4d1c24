So light! Watch yourself though, food is so light you may end up eating more than you should especially if you are trying to watch your waistline:)\n\nHe felt each coffee cake piece (to put in the bag) and didn't sell me one that felt soggy to the touch.  Asked for pork buns and he went to get the ones in the back that were fresh and cooling down.  Heated up the one piece I was going to eat in the car. (pork bun was so tasty!) All that without me having to ask. \n\nMy fave are the mini sponge cakes with whipped topping and fruit on top, it's a little piece of heaven.  Having a party?

Excited because of the recliner seats. Overwhelmed when we stepped inside. The Marketplace was...well, we thought it was like a hospital cafeteria with a lot less staff and a giant mess. Popcorn all over the floors and counters, condiments spilled, condiment droppings on the counter. Saw 2 girls with brooms - not cleaning but chatting it up with the cashier.\n\nGotta line up 3 times, one to order, another to pay, and another to pick up your order. Pure confusion for a 1st timer. So you go back, front, and back. Liked the soda machine cause you pick and mix. The 'bar?' It looks like  and afterthought with I think 5 stools.\n\nThe bathroom. GROSS. 4 stalls not completely flushed and 1 with wet droppings on the floor. 2 sinks without soap and the used papertowels were overflowing. The automatic machine was rolling the new ones into the used ones. Did I mention there was red\/brown debris on the stainless steel? \n\nOk recliners but I doubt anyone actually measured the distance from the screen to the seats because we were on 2nd to last row and it still felt too close.

We searched Yelp and found him with all good reviews which made us decide to go to him for these very important pictures. The results are very disappointing! \n\nJon seems to be a friendly person, except that in the beginning he tried to deny a Yelp deal that we purchased, as he claimed the deal is for family photos only, which was NOT said in the deal description when we purchased. Anyhow he accepted the deal we bought eventually. However, it turned out to be a terrible experience.  \n\nFirst of all, his studio is in his house, or maybe more specifically, in his garage. Certainly it is not fun to take a one-hour-photo-shoot at such a place when the temperature is over 100 outside and there is limited air-conditioning in the garage. He had to use a fan trying to make it cooler. But most importantly, his technique is not very impressive at all.  My green dress turned out to be blue in my photos! The skin tone of my face in the pictures turned out to be uneven, despite the fact I was put on make-up by professional beauty artist. Also, his so-called touch-ups of the pictures are awful, that he didn't even try to take the shines on my face away! --- As a matter of fact, I don't think those pictures we purchased have been touched up at all!  \n\nI am not sure if he is good at taking family pictures as other claimed in the reviews, but if you go for professional head-shots, I won't recommend him at all. It will be a total waste of your money and time!","useful":9,"funny":0,"cool":0}

All of the construction was completely annoying, but one of the dealers in particular was pretty much a racist, and decided to get in a racially-motivated political debate with me.  Completely inappropriate.  She also wouldn't stop complaining about how she's made minimum wage there for like 10 years, which says something about their judgement to employ someone like that for 10 years without firing them.  She also made me feel really guilty for dropping a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table instead of tipping her that money.  I wish I had someone to report her to, but they don't really seem to care.

A lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by last weekend. First off, they have an amazing staff. Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.\n\nThe food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?! The only reason I gave three stars is because I liked the staff and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming back unless one of my friends who love this place really wants to go.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}
